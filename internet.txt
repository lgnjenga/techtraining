# Internet Basics Summary

## What is the Internet?

- **Definition:**
  - The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, allowing the exchange of information and communication through standardized protocols.

- **Key Points:**
  - Worldwide connectivity.
  - Utilizes a variety of technologies (wired, wireless).
  - Enables access to vast resources, services, and information.

## How Does Information Move on the Internet?

- **Data Transmission:**
  - Information is broken into packets for efficient transmission.
  - Packets travel across various networks to reach their destination.
  - Routers, switches, and servers play crucial roles in routing and forwarding packets.

- **Protocols:**
  - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is fundamental.
  - Data travels through layers (physical, data link, network, transport, application) using protocols.

## How Do Networks Talk to Each Other and Protocols Involved?

- **Networking:**
  - Devices communicate using standardized protocols.
  - Protocols define rules for data exchange and network management.
  - Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, DNS.

- **Internet Protocols:**
  - TCP ensures reliable data delivery.
  - IP manages addressing and routing.
  - HTTP governs web communication.

## Relationship Between Packets, Routers, and Reliability

- **Packets:**
  - Information is divided into packets for transmission.
  - Each packet contains data, source, destination information.

- **Routers:**
  - Routers direct packets between networks.
  - Make decisions based on routing tables.

- **Reliability:**
  - Protocols like TCP ensure reliable delivery by acknowledging received packets.
  - Redundancy and error-checking enhance reliability.

## HTTP and HTML â€“ How Are You Viewing This Webpage in Your Browser?

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
  - Defines how web browsers and servers communicate.
  - Utilizes a request-response model.

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**
  - Language for structuring content on the web.
  - Renders webpages with text, images, links.

## How is Information Transfer on the Internet Made Secure?

- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
  - Protocols for secure communication over a computer network.
  - Encrypts data to ensure confidentiality.

- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**
  - Combines HTTP and SSL/TLS.
  - Encrypts data during transmission for secure browsing.

## What is Cybersecurity and What are Some Common Internet Crimes?

- **Cybersecurity:**
  - Encompasses measures to protect systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
  - Includes technologies, processes, and practices.

- **Common Internet Crimes:**
  - Phishing: Deceptive attempts to acquire sensitive information.
  - Malware: Software designed to harm or exploit systems.
  - DDoS Attacks: Overwhelming a system with traffic to disrupt services.
  - Identity Theft: Unauthorized use of personal information for fraudulent activities.
